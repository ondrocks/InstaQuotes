# InstaQuotes
This is a tool for creating non-motivational posters. Just give it an instagram profile, a wikiquote name to search and a language.

Call example:
```
python InstaQuotes.py natgeo "Snoop Dogg" en
```
The login is by default deactivated but it can be activated by uncommenting the lines in getLogin. Without an approved follow and a login you can only download the public pictures, which is what the script does by default.

Languages supported: en, es, de, fr, it

Quotes are necessary if the search for wikiquote has a space in between.
